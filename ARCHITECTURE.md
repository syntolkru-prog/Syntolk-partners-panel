# Architecture

A user-facing map of how OpenPartner works. If you're contributing code, read [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) instead — it covers the invariants we hold ourselves to. This doc is for people evaluating or integrating.

## The pipeline

```
click  →  identity  →  event  →  attribution  →  commission  →  payout
(raw)    (stitched)   (raw)     (derived)        (derived)      (derived)
```

Each arrow is a discrete table and a discrete step. The left two columns are raw, immutable data. The right three are derived — computed from the raw layers on demand, or whenever new events land.

| Table | What's in it |
| --- | --- |
| `Click` | One row per link hit. `clickId` (ULID), `linkKey`, `partnerId`, `campaignId`, `landingUrl`, hashed IP, UA, `fraudFlag`. |
| `Identity` | Links `clickId` → `userId` when the user signs up or logs in with an active `cref` cookie. One row per `(clickId, userId)` pair — multi-touch is preserved. |
| `Event` | Conversion events. `userId`, `type` (`signup`, `invoice_paid`, etc.), `value`, `currency`. Merchant's server-to-server events OR mapped Stripe webhook events. |
| `Attribution` | For an Event, the partner(s) credited under a given attribution model. Unique on `(eventId, model, clickId)`. |
| `Commission` | Money owed to a partner for an Attribution, priced via the campaign's commission rule. Ledger with immutable status transitions: `accrued → approved → paid` (or `reversed`). |
| `Payout` | Groups approved commissions by partner + currency. `method = stripe_connect | manual`. In Stripe Connect mode carries the transfer id. |

## Why event-sourced?

Raw data is immutable. Attribution is a view — you can re-run it with a different model (last-click, first-click, linear, position) without re-collecting data. You can also correct an attribution model retroactively over historical events. And because raw data is the only load-bearing layer, export is simple: dump the raw + derived tables, re-import on another instance, re-derive from there. Nothing lossy in that chain — see docs/data-portability.md for the exact table set and the hosted-billing sidecars that are not in it yet.

Concretely this buys you:

- **Change your attribution model later.** Switch from last-click to linear in six months and re-derive history, because every click and event is still there.
- **Lossless migration.** A one-click JSON bundle round-trips into a self-hosted instance.
- **Reproducibility.** Given the same click log + event log, two instances will derive identical attributions + commissions.

The cost is storage — six growing tables instead of one — and a small runtime cost to recompute when re-attributing historical events. Worth it.

## Click routing

`apps/router` is a Hono service that owns the `/r/:linkKey` hot path. A click does three things:

1. Write a `Click` row (with hashed IP, UA, referer, optional `fraudFlag` from velocity check).
2. Set a first-party `_cref` cookie scoped to `COOKIE_DOMAIN` — 90 day max-age, `SameSite=Lax`.
3. 302 to the landing URL with `?cref=<clickId>` appended, so the SDK can also pick it up when the cookie gets dropped by ITP.

Portability: Hono runs on Node and on Cloudflare Workers unchanged. Self-hosters who want to run the click router at the edge can.

## Identity stitching

The hard part of attribution is surviving Safari (ITP caps first-party cookies to 7 days), multi-device, and delayed signup (someone clicks on Monday, signs up on Friday). OpenPartner's stitch is a simple state machine:

1. SDK on the landing page reads `?cref=…` and the `_cref` cookie, stores both in `localStorage` (immune to ITP).
2. When the user authenticates, the SDK calls `POST /attribution/identify { cref, userId }`.
3. The API writes an `Identity` row and re-runs attribution for any prior events that user has already generated (the "backlog" path — matters when webhook order is weird).

A user who clicks on their phone, opens the landing page, doesn't sign up, then signs up on their laptop a month later: the cref travels through `localStorage` if the tab stays open, or the click is lost. A user who clicks, signs up in the same browser session, and returns weeks later: stitched. Cross-device without login is explicitly out of scope — we rely on the login being the identity bridge.

## Attribution models

Four models ship. Each Event, when ingested, writes one or more `Attribution` rows:

- **last_click** — the most recent click within the window. One attribution row.
- **first_click** — the oldest click within the window. One attribution row.
- **linear** — every click in the window gets equal credit. N attribution rows, weight `1/N`.
- **position** — first + last click get 40% each, middle clicks split the remaining 20%.

Model is per-campaign (`Campaign.attributionModel`). Change it and the next re-attribution run picks up the new setting. The attribution window is also per-campaign (default 60 days).

## Commissions + payouts

Commission = attribution + pricing rule. Rules live on the Campaign:

- **percent** — percentage of the event's `value`. `recurring: true` means every recurring invoice counts, not just the first.
- **fixed** — flat amount per event (signup bounties).

Commissions enter `accrued` state. An admin (or approval webhook flow) moves them to `approved`. The payouts runner groups approved commissions by `(partnerId, currency)` and writes a Payout row plus a Stripe transfer (Connect mode) or leaves it `pending` for the operator to clear out-of-band (manual mode).

Idempotency: each Payout gets a ULID up front, used as the Stripe idempotency key. A retry after a crash doesn't double-transfer.

## Deployment modes

One codebase, three behaviors, flipped by `OPENPARTNER_MODE`:

| Mode | Merchant billing | Partner payouts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `selfhost` | — | Operator manages out-of-band. |
| `flat` | Stripe Checkout subscription (`STRIPE_FLAT_PRICE_ID`). | Stripe Connect Standard. |
| `revshare` | 3% of each payout retained as platform fee, recorded on `Payout.metadata.platformFee`. | Stripe Connect Standard. |

The core product — attribution, events, commissions — is identical across modes. Only the billing + payout layer changes.

## Install + auth

First-run is a three-step wizard at `/install` — admin account (name + email), program name + support email, and mail transport. On submit the first admin gets an emailed magic link; clicking it activates them with a session cookie. `/install` 409s once any admin is activated so a second party can't take over.

**Personas** are first-class — neither admins nor partners authenticate with a shared token:

- **Admin** — invited by another admin (or created during install), verifies a magic link, gets a `Session` cookie keyed `(principalKind='admin', principalId)`. Can invite / revoke / reinstate other admins, edit program + mail settings. `ADMIN_API_KEY` env stays valid as a bootstrap / headless / CI bearer; think `doctl`, migrations, or emergency access.
- **Partner** — invited by an admin, same magic-link flow, separate `Partner` table. Creates their own Links + API keys from their dashboard; admin never sees partner credentials. Revocation kills sessions in-transaction and stamps clicks `fraudFlag='revoked'` so future attribution skips them without breaking the end-user click experience.

Magic-link tokens and sessions share one generalized schema (`MagicLinkToken`, `Session`) keyed by `(principalKind, principalId)`. The verify endpoint branches on `principalKind` — invites for partners stamp `Partner.activatedAt`, invites for admins stamp `Admin.activatedAt`.

## Settings + secret encryption

Anything user-facing and runtime-adjustable lives in the `Config` table, editable from the admin Settings UI — not env. This covers:

- **Program settings** — program name + support email (plaintext, identifiers not secrets)
- **Mail settings** — SMTP or Postmark selection + credentials

Credentials inside `Config` (SMTP password, Postmark server token) are AES-256-GCM encrypted at rest using `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` — the one env-level secret required in production. Public readers of the Settings API get a sanitized view (`hasPassword: true/false`) so the UI can show "saved ✓" without ever exposing plaintext.

Env vars like `SMTP_HOST` / `POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN` / `MAIL_FROM` remain as **fallbacks** — the mailer resolves UI config first, env second, console stdout last (dev only). Hosted deployments can force a transport via env; self-hosters who want to rotate credentials without a redeploy do so from the Settings page.

## Federating with an external creator network

OpenPartner OSS is vendor-direct — the admin creates Partner rows, issues share links, and manages their own partner program. A separate hosted service (outside this repo) implements a two-sided creator network: vendors publish offerings, creators apply, and approved partnerships federate back into each vendor's OpenPartner instance as Partner + Link rows.

The federation contract is thin: the vendor mints a scoped API key (`partners:write`, `links:write`, `partners:read`, `commissions:read`) and hands it to the network. The network calls the vendor's public API as an authenticated client — no shared schema, no inbound connections into the vendor. Data stays on the vendor's instance. Revoke the key and federation stops.

Not participating in any network is the default. Everything in this repo works standalone.

## Data portability

Every core table round-trips through `GET /export.json`. Two guarantees:

1. **Stable schema.** Column shapes don't change within a major version. Additions are allowed; renames or removals are migrations with explicit export-compat handling.
2. **No hosted-only fields on core tables.** If the hosted version needs metadata (billing customer IDs, rate-limit tokens), it goes in a sidecar table clearly labeled as optional. Self-host imports ignore it.

Import is `POST /import` (selfhost-only — importing into a shared hosted DB would collide primary keys). Each table uses its OWN primary key as the conflict target with `.ignore()` (`PartnerCommission` is keyed on `partnerId`, not `id`), so partial-then-resumed imports and re-imports of the same bundle are no-ops.

## Observability

- **Structured logs.** Pino, JSON. Every log line carries the request's `reqId`, correlated with the `X-Request-Id` response header (echoed from inbound if the client sends one, ULID otherwise).
- **Metrics.** `GET /metrics` — Prometheus text, open by default. Set `METRICS_TOKEN` to require a Bearer token.
- **Health.** `GET /health` on each service, no auth.

## What this isn't

- **Not a link shortener.** Dub's best in class for that.
- **Not a CRM.** Partner roster is minimal; integrate with your existing CRM for rich partner profiles.
- **Not a fraud detection platform.** Basic velocity + review queue. Enterprise fraud ML is post-Series-A territory.
- **Not a merchant of record.** Merchants keep their own Stripe accounts; we never process consumer purchases.
