/**
 * Campaign → Network Offering sync.
 *
 * The brand admin only manages campaigns. When a campaign has
 * `shareOnNetwork=true` and the tenant is connected to the Network, every
 * save triggers an auto-upsert of the corresponding Network Offering. The
 * Offering becomes a back-end mirror — never user-edited directly.
 *
 * Sync semantics:
 *   shareOnNetwork=true && no networkOfferingId  → create offering, store id
 *   shareOnNetwork=true && have networkOfferingId → patch existing offering
 *   shareOnNetwork=false && have networkOfferingId → patch published=false
 *
 * Failures are non-fatal: if the Network is down or rejects the call, we
 * log + continue (the campaign save itself succeeds). The brand can re-save
 * the campaign to retry, or unflip + reflip the toggle.
 *
 * The terms payload mirrors what the previous offering admin form built —
 * compound rules + customer reward + attribution snapshot — so creator-side
 * filters and the discover card render identically.
