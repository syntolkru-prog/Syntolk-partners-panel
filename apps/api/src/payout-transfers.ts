/**
 * Payout transfer EXECUTOR — the money-moving half of the direct-Connect
 * rail (audit #10). Consumes the durable intents `runPayouts` committed
 * (payouts.ts) and posts the Stripe transfers OUTSIDE any transaction,
 * one short transaction per state change.
 *
 * This is the legacy/self-host sibling of `funding/executor.ts` and follows
 * the same discipline, because the same failure modes apply:
 *
 *   - The intent (the Payout row) is COMMITTED before any Stripe call, so
 *     its id — and the idempotency key `payout_<id>` derived from it — is
 *     durable. A crash retries the SAME key instead of minting a new one.
 *   - The commission set is frozen by the planner (`Commission.payoutId`
 *     stamped while status stays 'approved'), so a retry can't silently
 *     grow the transfer to include commissions approved in the meantime.
 *     That is exactly the double-pay a "deterministic key over the
 *     commission set" would cause.
 *   - An ambiguous outcome (network error / timeout — the transfer may or
 *     may not exist) NEVER leads to a blind re-POST once Stripe's ~24h
 *     idempotency-key window has passed. Past the window we list transfers
 *     by `transfer_group` and match our metadata stamp.
 *
 * State lives in `Payout.metadata.transferState`:
 *
 *   intent   → committed, nothing sent to Stripe yet
 *   posted   → a transfers.create was issued; outcome may be unknown
 *   confirmed→ transfer exists, Payout paid, commissions paid
 *   reconcile_required → posted, past the idempotency window, needs listing
 *   canceled → abandoned before any Stripe call; claims released
 *
 * Every transition is a compare-and-set on that field, so two workers
 * racing the same intent can't both act on it.
 *
 * Runs on the PRIVILEGED db (like the funding executor): it processes
 * every tenant's intents in one pass and cannot hold a tenant-scoped
 * transaction open across Stripe calls. Pass `tenantId` to scope it — the
 * admin "run payouts" endpoint does, so its response reflects the outcome.
