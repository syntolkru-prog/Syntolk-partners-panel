/**
 * Soft trial-gate.
 *
 * Two tiers of 402 gating:
 *   - PLAN_REQUIRED (partner onboarding): needs an ACTIVE subscription
 *     regardless of trial — a brand must pick a plan before it onboards
 *     its first partner (each brand is its own separately-billed tenant).
 *     error = 'plan_required'.
 *   - TRIAL_GATED (program expansion): soft-blocked only once the 14-day
 *     trial lapses without a subscription. error = 'trial_expired'.
 *
 * Either way the product keeps working — clicks still get recorded,
 * attribution still runs, the dashboard still renders, the admin can still
 * subscribe — we only gate the specific write actions listed below.
 *
 * What's gated:
 *   - POST /campaigns                       (create new program)
 *   - POST /partners                        (invite new partner OR
 *                                            federated approval landing)
 *   - POST /partners/:id/coupons            (mint coupon)
 *   - POST /partners/:id/programs          (grant program to partner)
 *   - POST /import/partners-csv             (bulk roster import)
 *   - POST /admin/network/offerings         (publish on the Network)
 *   - POST /admin/network/requests/:id/approve  (approve creator
 *                                            application coming through
 *                                            the Network)
 *
 * What stays open (deliberate):
 *   - GET *                           (read; show their data)
 *   - POST /attribution/identify      (SDK callback — customer signed up)
 *   - POST /attribution/events        (SDK callback — revenue happened)
 *   - POST /coupons/redeem            (customer used a coupon at checkout)
 *   - POST /webhooks/stripe           (Stripe → us)
 *   - POST /billing/*                 (resubscribe, open portal)
 *   - POST /signin /signup /admins/login etc. (auth)
 *   - POST /attribution/* and click-router endpoints
 *
 * Rationale: don't silently lose attribution data the customer might
 * resubscribe to retrieve, and don't make them debug "why does the
 * SDK return errors" before they've seen the trial-expired banner.
