## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: All commissions show 20%

**Possible Causes:**
1. Partner Groups not loaded
2. Affiliates not assigned to groups
3. Browser cache

**Solutions:**
```powershell
# 1. Clear cache and restart
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next
npm run dev

# 2. Hard refresh browser
Ctrl + Shift + R

# 3. Check browser console
F12 → Console → Look for errors
```

### Issue: Commission shows ₹0.00

**Check:**
1. Did affiliate enter estimated value?
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Look for `ref.estimatedValue` in network tab
4. Verify `/api/admin/referrals` response includes `estimatedValue`

### Issue: Partner Group not found

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check affiliate's partner group in database
SELECT id, payout_details FROM affiliates;

-- Should show: {"partnerGroup": "Premium"}
-- If empty, update via admin dashboard
```

## 🎯 Manual Calculation Verification

Use this to verify calculations are correct:

```javascript
// Formula
Commission = Estimated Value × (Commission Rate ÷ 100)

// Examples:
₹10,000 × (20 ÷ 100) = ₹10,000 × 0.20 = ₹2,000  ✅
₹10,000 × (25 ÷ 100) = ₹10,000 × 0.25 = ₹2,500  ✅
₹10,000 × (30 ÷ 100) = ₹10,000 × 0.30 = ₹3,000  ✅

₹5,000 × (20 ÷ 100) = ₹5,000 × 0.20 = ₹1,000   ✅
₹8,000 × (25 ÷ 100) = ₹8,000 × 0.25 = ₹2,000   ✅
₹15,000 × (30 ÷ 100) = ₹15,000 × 0.30 = ₹4,500  ✅
```
