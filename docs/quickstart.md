# Quickstart

End-to-end walkthrough: spin up the stack, run first-run install, invite a partner, simulate a click, stitch an identity, post an event, approve the commission, run a payout, export the data.

## 1. Spin up

```bash
git clone https://github.com/getcoherence/openpartner
cd openpartner
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env: set ADMIN_API_KEY (bootstrap) and SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY
# (both random 32-byte hex). Generate each with:
#   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
pnpm install
docker compose up -d postgres
pnpm migrate

pnpm dev:api       # :4601
pnpm dev:router    # :4701
pnpm dev:portal    # :5673
```

## 2. First-run install (UI)

Open **http://localhost:5673/install** — a three-step wizard:

1. **You** — admin name + email
2. **Program** — program name + optional support email (surfaced to partners in their footer)
3. **Email delivery** — SMTP or Postmark credentials (stored encrypted in the DB) or "None" to print magic links to the `pnpm dev:api` console

On submit, OpenPartner emails you a one-time activation link. Click it and you're signed in as the first admin with a session cookie. From here, everything else is admin UI — no more curl bootstrap.

> The `ADMIN_API_KEY` env remains valid as a headless / CI bearer. Everything below works with either auth mode.

## 3. Bootstrap via API (headless)

If you'd rather skip the wizard for scripted setups, the admin key still works as a bearer token.

```bash
export ADMIN=$(grep '^ADMIN_API_KEY=' .env | cut -d= -f2)

# Create a partner.
PARTNER=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:4601/partners \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"ada@example.com","name":"Ada"}' | jq -r .id)
# ^ Also emails Ada an invite with a magic link. She clicks it, sets
#   up her own partner dashboard session — admin never sees her creds.

# Create a campaign (20% recurring percent rule).
CAMPAIGN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:4601/campaigns \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Default","commissionRule":{"type":"percent","value":20,"recurring":true}}' | jq -r .id)

# Partners create their own Links — but admin can seed one for
# testing. In the real UX the partner does this from their dashboard.
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:4601/partners/$PARTNER/links \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"linkKey\":\"ada\",\"campaignId\":\"$CAMPAIGN\",\"destinationUrl\":\"https://example.com/signup\"}"
```

## 4. Simulate the funnel

```bash
# Click — router sets _cref cookie, writes Click row, 302s to destinationUrl.
CLICK=$(curl -sI http://localhost:4701/r/ada | grep -i '^set-cookie' | sed -E 's/.*_cref=([^;]+).*/\1/' | tr -d '\r')

# Stitch a user (this is what the SDK's identify() call does).
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:4601/attribution/identify \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"cref\":\"$CLICK\",\"userId\":\"user_123\"}"

# Server-to-server revenue event.
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:4601/attribution/events \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId":"user_123","type":"invoice_paid","value":200,"currency":"USD"}'
```

## 5. Review + payout

```bash
# The commission is 'accrued'; approve it.
COMMISSION=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN" \
  "http://localhost:4601/partners/$PARTNER/commissions" | jq -r '.commissions[0].id')

curl -s -X POST http://localhost:4601/commissions/$COMMISSION/approve \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN"

# Connect Stripe (opens a hosted onboarding URL — partner completes there).
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:4601/partners/$PARTNER/connect/start \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"returnUrl":"http://localhost:5673","refreshUrl":"http://localhost:5673"}'

# Run the payout batch (requires partner to have completed Connect).
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:4601/payouts/run \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN"
```

## 6. Export / import

```bash
# Full dump — round-trippable into a self-hosted instance.
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN" \
  http://localhost:4601/export.json > export.json

# One table at a time, CSV or JSON.
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN" \
  http://localhost:4601/export/Click.csv > clicks.csv

# On a fresh selfhost instance:
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:4601/import \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  --data @export.json
```

## 7. Deployment modes

Set `OPENPARTNER_MODE` in `.env`:

| Mode | Billing | Partner payouts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `selfhost` | none | operator handles out-of-band |
| `flat` | merchant subscription (Stripe Checkout via `POST /billing/checkout`; set `STRIPE_FLAT_PRICE_ID`) | Stripe Connect Standard |
| `revshare` | 3% of each payout retained as platform fee (tracked in `Payout.metadata.platformFee`) | Stripe Connect Standard |

See `/billing/status` for the current state, and `/billing/portal` in `flat` mode for the merchant's Stripe customer portal.

## 8. Browser SDK

```ts
import { OpenPartner } from '@openpartner/sdk';

const op = OpenPartner.init({ apiUrl: 'https://openpartner.example.com' });

// On login or signup:
op.identify(currentUser.id);
```

The SDK captures `?cref=…` from the landing URL and the `_cref` cookie, stashes in localStorage so the attribution survives ITP / multi-session gaps, then POSTs to `/attribution/identify` when you call `identify()`.

## 9. Server SDK

For conversion events your backend controls (custom events, non-Stripe billing):

```ts
import { OpenPartnerServer } from '@openpartner/sdk/server';

const op = new OpenPartnerServer({
  apiUrl: process.env.OPENPARTNER_API_URL!,
  apiKey: process.env.OPENPARTNER_API_KEY!,
});

await op.trackEvent({
  userId: user.id,
  type: 'invoice_paid',
  value: 249,
  currency: 'USD',
});
```

See [`packages/sdk/README.md`](../packages/sdk/README.md) for full integration docs, including framework notes and error handling.
