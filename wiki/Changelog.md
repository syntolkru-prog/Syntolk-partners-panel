## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-17

### 🔒 Production Hardening, Admin Expansion & Affiliate Portal

This release delivers critical security fixes, eliminates PrismaClient connection leaks across 36 files, adds 7 new admin pages, 5 affiliate sub-pages, 10+ new API routes, and a comprehensive 156-assertion production test suite. The platform is now verified production-ready.

### 🔒 Security Fixes (CRITICAL)

- **Login JWT Cookie** — Login API now creates JWT token via `SignJWT` and sets `auth-token` HTTP-only cookie (was missing entirely)
- **Password Hashing** — Admin affiliate creation now hashes passwords with `bcrypt.hash(password, 12)` (was storing plain text)
- **Referral Tracking** — `/r/[code]` route completely rewritten from broken `localStorage` mock to production Prisma queries (finds affiliate by `referralCode`, creates referral record, tracks click in `ReferralClick` table)
- **JWT Secret Standardization** — All 20+ route files standardized to single fallback secret (previously 3 different strings caused cross-route auth failures)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes (HIGH)

- **Commission Rates** — Referral approval now uses `partnerGroup.commissionRate` and `metadata.estimated_value` instead of hardcoded 10%/₹100 values
- **DELETE API Bugs** — Fixed 2 critical DELETE handlers that crashed with `prisma.undefined.delete()` due to wrong model references
- **PrismaClient Singleton** — Migrated 36 files from `new PrismaClient()` to shared singleton import, eliminating connection pool exhaustion in production
- **Invoice Delete** — Added missing delete functionality to admin invoices page (Trash2 icon + confirmation dialog)
