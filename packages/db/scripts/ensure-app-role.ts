/**
 * Idempotent app-role provisioning, run on every boot.
 *
 * The original role-creation lives in migration 20260507020000_app_role.ts
 * — but that's a one-shot: knex_migrations marks it applied and never
 * re-runs. So if OPENPARTNER_APP_DB_PASSWORD changes after the first
 * apply (or was unset on first apply and set later), there's no path
 * back into the migration. Postgres ends up with a different password
 * than the env, and the app pool fails authentication forever.
 *
 * This script reconciles every boot: if the env var is set, the role
 * exists with that exact password and has the necessary grants. Safe
 * to run on a healthy DB — every statement is idempotent.
 *
 * Skipped entirely when OPENPARTNER_APP_DB_PASSWORD is unset, matching
 * the migration's behavior so self-hosters who don't want RLS aren't
 * forced into role management.
